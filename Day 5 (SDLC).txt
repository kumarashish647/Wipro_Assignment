 1. Scrum Master

 The Scrum Master acts as a facilitator and coach for the Scrum Team. Their main responsibilities include:

- Facilitating Scrum Events: Ensuring that daily standups, sprint planning, sprint reviews, and retrospectives occur and are effective.
- Removing Impediments: Helping the team identify and remove any obstacles that prevent progress.
- Ensuring Scrum Practices: Educating the team and the organization about Scrum principles and ensuring they are followed.
- Supporting the Product Owner: Assisting the Product Owner in managing the product backlog and ensuring it is visible, transparent, and understood.
- Protecting the Team: Shielding the team from external interruptions and distractions to maintain focus and productivity.
- Coaching the Team: Helping the team become self-organizing and cross-functional, and continuously improving.

 2. Product Owner

The Product Owner represents the stakeholders and is responsible for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Development Team. Key responsibilities include:

- Managing the Product Backlog: Creating, prioritizing, and maintaining the product backlog, ensuring it reflects current project requirements and priorities.

- Self-Organizing: Managing their own work and internal processes without being directed by others outside the team.
- Cross-Functional: Possessing all the skills necessary to create a product increment.
- Delivering Increments: Producing a potentially shippable product increment at the end of each Sprint.
