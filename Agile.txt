1) Difference between scrum vs Kanban?
Ans:-

 -Scrum vs. Kanban: Key Differences

  1. Workflow Management :-

-   Scrum  :-

  - Time-boxed Sprints**: Work is divided into fixed-length iterations called sprints, usually 2-4 weeks long.
  - Defined Scope**: The scope of work is fixed for each sprint.

-   Kanban :-

  - Continuous Flow : Work items are pulled through the process as capacity permits, without fixed timeframes.
  - Flexible Scope  : Work items can be added or removed as needed.

2. Roles and Responsibilities :-
-  Scrum :-

  - Specific Roles : Defined roles such as Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Development Team.

- Kanban :-

  - No Prescribed Roles**: Roles are flexible and typically align with existing team structures.

3. Process and Ceremonies :-

-   Scrum :-

  - Regular Ceremonies : Includes Sprint Planning, Daily Standups, Sprint Reviews, and Sprint Retrospectives.
  - Sprint Planning : At the start of each sprint to define goals and tasks.
  - Sprint Retrospective : At the end of each sprint to reflect on improvements.

-   Kanban :-

  - Minimal Ceremonies : Focuses on continuous workflow without mandatory ceremonies.
  - Continuous Improvement : Adjustments are made continuously rather than at the end of a sprint.

4. Visual Management :-

-   Scrum  :-

  - Sprint Backlog : A list of tasks for the current sprint.
  - Burndown Charts  : Track the progress of work within a sprint.

-   Kanban  :-

  - Kanban Board : Visualizes the entire workflow with columns representing different stages (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).
  - Work In Progress (WIP) Limits : Limits the number of tasks in each stage to manage flow and prevent bottlenecks.

5. Flexibility and Adaptability:-

- Scrum :-

  - Less Flexible : Scope changes are discouraged during a sprint.
  - Structured  : Follows a set structure with defined roles and ceremonies.

- Kanban  :-

  - Highly Flexible : Changes can be made at any time.
  - Adaptive**: More adaptable to changing priorities and work requirements.

6. Focus  :-

- Scrum  :-

  -Predictable Delivery  : Focuses on delivering a potentially shippable product increment at the end of each sprint.

- Kanban  :-

  - Efficiency and Flow**: Focuses on optimizing the flow of work and improving process efficiency.

 Summary  :-

- Scrum is suitable for projects that benefit from a structured approach with regular, predictable delivery cycles and clear roles.
- Kanban is ideal for teams seeking flexibility, continuous delivery, and a visual approach to managing work with minimal predefined roles and ceremonies.

2) Write 3 user stories with acceptance creteria?
Ans:-

  - User Story 1: As a User, I want to reset my password

 User Story : 

 As a user, I want to reset my password so that I can regain access to my account if I forget my current password.

 Acceptance Criteria :

1. Given I am on the login page, when I click on the "Forgot Password" link, then I should be redirected to the password reset page.
2. Given I am on the password reset page, when I enter my registered email address and click "Submit," then I should receive a password reset email.
3. Given I receive the password reset email, when I click on the reset link in the email, then I should be redirected to a page where I can enter a new password.
4. Given I am on the password reset page, when I enter a new password and confirm it, then my password should be updated, and I should be able to log in with the new password.

 User Story 2: As a User, I want to filter products by category

 User Story :-
 
 As a user, I want to filter products by category so that I can easily find the type of products I am looking for.

  Acceptance Criteria  :-

1. Given I am on the products page, when I select a category from the filter options, then only the products that belong to that category should be displayed.
2. Given I have applied a category filter, when I clear the filter, then all products should be displayed again.
3. Given I have selected multiple categories, when I apply the filters, then the products belonging to any of the selected categories should be displayed.
4. Given there are no products in the selected category, when I apply the filter, then a message stating "No products found in this category" should be displayed.

 - User Story 3: As an Admin, I want to generate a monthly sales report

  User Story  :- 

  As an admin, I want to generate a monthly sales report so that I can analyze the sales performance of the past month.

  Acceptance Criteria  :-

1. Given I am on the admin dashboard, when I navigate to the "Reports" section and select "Monthly Sales Report," then I should be prompted to select a month.
2. Given I have selected a month and clicked "Generate Report," when the report is generated, then it should display total sales, number of orders, and revenue for the selected month.
3. Given the report is generated, when I click "Download Report," then a CSV file containing the sales data for the selected month should be downloaded to my device.
4. Given the report is generated, when I click "View Details," then I should see a breakdown of sales by product, including quantities sold and revenue generated for each product.
